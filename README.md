# Awesome Danish
A curated list of awesome resources for Danish language technology

## Corpora
* [CLARIN-DK](https://repository.clarin.dk/repository/xmlui/) - A searchable set of many different Danish-language corpora, compiled as part of CLARIN work at CST.
* [NST-ngrams](http://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/show?serial=sbr-28) - A N-gram frequency list compiled by Nordisk Språkteknologi from newspaper text and made available by the Norwegian Library Service. Can be compiled to an n-gram LM with SRILM.
* [NST-speech-22khz](http://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/show?serial=sbr-20) - A 22kHz speech corpus compiled by Nordisk Språkteknologi and made available by the Norwegian Library Service. The speech genre is dictation.
* [NST-speech-16kHz](http://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/show?serial=sbr-19) - A 16kHz speech corpus compiled by Nordisk Språkteknologi and made available by the Norwegian Library Service. The speech genre is read-aloud and the text is phonetically balanced. Designed for ASR training and testing.
* [NST-speech-44kHz](http://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/show?serial=sbr-21) - A 44kHz speech corpus compiled by Nordisk Språkteknologi and made available by the Norwegian Library Service. Designed for speech synthesis.

## Dictionaries
* [NST-lexical-database](http://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/show?serial=sbr-26) A pronunciation dictionary compiled by Nordisk Språkteknologi and made available by the Norwegian Library Service.

## Automatic Speech Recognition
* [kaldi-sprakbanken](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs/sprakbanken/s5) - A recipe for training state-of-the-art(2017) speech recogniser for Danish based on the 16kHz NST database.

## Speech Synthesis (text-to-speech)
* [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) - An open-source speech synthesis program for ~56 languages including Danish. eSpeak can also be used as a grapheme-to-phoneme converter and was used to create the Danish Kaldi recipe.

## Sentiment analysis
- [AFINN](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn/tree/master/afinn/data) - Danish lexicons annotated for sentiment.  
- [afinn](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn/) - Python package with AFINN Danish lexicon annotated for sentiment, also installable with `pip install afinn`.

## Lexical norms
- [concreteness-estimates-da](https://github.com/billdthompson/cogsci-auto-norm/blob/master/results/concreteness-estimates-da.csv) - Bill D. Thompson's concreteness estimates for Danish words, as detailed in *[Automatic Estimation of Lexical Concreteness in 77 Languages](http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2622741/component/escidoc:2622739/Thompson_Lupyan_2018.pdf)* ([Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/work/Q56219750)).
